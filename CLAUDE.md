# Pump Bot Development Guide

This is a trading bot for pump.fun and letsbonk.fun platforms that snipes new tokens and implements various trading strategies.

## NEVER ASK THE USER TO QUIT

**Hard rule, no exceptions.** Never ask the user any variant of:
- "Should we stop for the night?"
- "Should we call it off?"
- "Should we give up?"
- "Should we pause here?"
- "Want me to keep going or stop?"
- "Should we revisit tomorrow?"

If a bug exists and a hypothesis exists, **execute the fix**. The user has explicitly said: "don't stop until it's all done and working." That's the standing order. Treat ANY question about stopping as a violation of that order.

Stop only when:
1. The user explicitly tells you to stop, OR
2. You have NO hypothesis left to try AND have honestly exhausted diagnostic options.

If both stop conditions are false, keep building. If a fix attempt fails, debug it and try the next fix. Don't surface decision points the user doesn't need to make.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Main source code
- `learning-examples/` - Educational scripts and examples
- `bots/` - Bot configuration files (YAML)
- `logs/` - Log files from bot executions
- `idl/` - Interface definition files for Solana programs

## Bash Commands & Development

### Setup Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Activate virtual environment (Unix/macOS)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install as editable package
uv pip install -e .
```

### Running the Bot
```bash
# Run as installed package
pump_bot

# Run directly
uv run src/bot_runner.py
```

### Learning Examples
```bash
# Bonding curve status
uv run learning-examples/bonding-curve-progress/get_bonding_curve_status.py TOKEN_ADDRESS

# Listen to migrations
uv run learning-examples/listen-migrations/listen_logsubscribe.py
uv run learning-examples/listen-migrations/listen_blocksubscribe_old_raydium.py

# Compute associated bonding curve
uv run learning-examples/compute_associated_bonding_curve.py

# Listen to new tokens
uv run learning-examples/listen-new-tokens/listen_logsubscribe_abc.py

```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Format code
ruff format

ruff check

# Fix linting issues
ruff check --fix
```

## Pump.fun protocol notes (gotchas)

- The vendored IDL at `idl/pump_fun_idl.json` is **incomplete**: it does not list `bonding-curve-v2` (BC trades) or `pool-v2` (PumpSwap trades). Both are required on-chain. `bonding-curve-v2` PDA seed is `["bonding-curve-v2", mint]` under the pump program; `pool-v2` is `["pool-v2", base_mint]` under the pump-amm program. Always cross-check account lists against a recent successful on-chain tx — IDL alone will produce broken code.
- BC `buy` ix is **18 accounts** (post 2026-04-28 upgrade). The trailing account is one of 8 `BREAKING_FEE_RECIPIENTS` (mutable), AFTER `bonding-curve-v2`.
- BC `sell` ix is **16 accounts non-cashback / 17 cashback**. Cashback path inserts `user_volume_accumulator` (PDA seed `["user_volume_accumulator", user]`) BEFORE `bonding-curve-v2`. Detect cashback from byte 82 of the bonding-curve account data, or via the `is_cashback_coin` field returned by the curve manager.
- The BondingCurve account is **83 bytes** (was 81): trailing fields are `is_mayhem_mode: bool` then `is_cashback_coin: bool`. PumpSwap Pool is **245 bytes** with the same `is_cashback_coin` byte at offset 244.
- The IDL instruction is `create_v2` (snake_case). `create_v2` args: `name (str), symbol (str), uri (str), creator (pubkey), is_mayhem_mode (bool), is_cashback_enabled (OptionBool 1B)`. `OptionBool` is a struct wrapping a single bool — serialized as 1 byte, not 2.
- `extreme_fast_mode` skips the curve-state RPC fetch — make sure event parsers populate `is_mayhem_mode` and `is_cashback_coin` on `TokenInfo` from the `CreateEvent` payload (otherwise mayhem coins use the wrong fee_recipient and cashback coins use the wrong sell account count).

## Code Style & Conventions

### Python Style (Ruff Configuration)
- **Line length**: 88 characters
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces
- **Target Python**: 3.11+
- **Quote style**: Double quotes
- **Import sorting**: Enabled

### Linting Rules
- Security best practices (S)
- Type annotations (ANN)
- Exception handling (BLE, TRY)
- Code complexity (C90)
- Pylint conventions (PL)
- No commented-out code (ERA)

### Code Organization
- **Imports**: Standard library, third-party, local imports
- **Docstrings**: Google-style for functions and classes
- **Type hints**: Required for all public functions
- **Logging**: Use `get_logger(__name__)` pattern
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with proper logging

### File Structure Patterns
- `__init__.py` files for all packages
- Separate concerns: client, trading, monitoring, platforms
- Abstract base classes in `interfaces/`
- Platform-specific implementations in `platforms/`

## Workflow & Development Practices

### Configuration Management
- Environment variables in `.env` file
- Bot configurations in YAML files under `bots/`
- Platform detection from config files
- Validation of platform-listener combinations

### Logging
- Timestamped log files in `logs/` directory
- Format: `{bot_name}_{timestamp}.log`
- Different log levels for development vs production
- Centralized logger utility in `utils/logger.py`

### Trading Architecture
- Universal trader pattern for platform abstraction
- Platform-specific implementations (pumpfun, letsbonk)
- Position tracking and management
- Priority fee management (dynamic/fixed)

### Monitoring Systems
- Multiple listener types: logs, blocks, geyser, pumpportal
- Universal listeners with platform abstraction
- Event parsing and processing
- Real-time data stream handling

### Development Workflow
1. Make changes to source code
2. Run `ruff check --fix` for linting
3. Run `ruff format` for formatting
4. Test with learning examples (standalone scripts) before deploying bots
5. Use separate processes for production bot instances

### Bot Configuration
- YAML-based configuration files
- Environment variable interpolation
- Platform-specific settings
- Trading parameters (slippage, amounts, timeouts)
- Filter configurations for token selection
- Cleanup and account management settings

### Testing Strategy
- Learning examples serve as integration tests
- Manual testing with learning scripts
- Configuration validation before bot startup
- Logging verification for debugging

## Key Features

- **Multi-platform support**: pump.fun and letsbonk.fun
- **Multiple listening methods**: WebSocket logs, block subscription, Geyser
- **Trading strategies**: Time-based, take profit/stop loss, manual
- **Priority fee management**: Dynamic and fixed fee strategies
- **Account cleanup**: Automated token account management
- **Extreme fast mode**: Skip validation for faster execution

## Security Considerations

- Private keys stored in environment variables
- No sensitive data in configuration files
- Comprehensive input validation
- Error handling to prevent crashes
- Rate limiting and retry mechanisms
